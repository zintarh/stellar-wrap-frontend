# Testing Guide

This document provides information about running and maintaining tests for the Stellar Wrap project.

## Testing Strategy

This project currently uses a **dual test runner strategy** to leverage the strengths of each tool. A future migration to a single runner (Vitest) is planned – see the *Planned Migration to Single Runner* section below.

| Test Runner | Purpose | Test Files | Command |
|-------------|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Jest** | Unit tests, mocking, Next.js integration | `*.test.ts`, `*.test.tsx` | `pnpm test:unit` |
| **Vitest** | Integration tests, edge cases, comprehensive tests | `*.comprehensive.test.ts`, `*.edge.test.ts`, `*.integration.test.ts` | `pnpm test:integration` |
| **Playwright** | Visual regression, E2E tests | `*.spec.ts` (in e2e folder) | `pnpm test:visual` |

### Why Two Test Runners?

- **Jest**: Mature ecosystem, excellent Next.js integration, strong mocking capabilities. Used for standard unit tests.
- **Vitest**: Fast, modern, native ESM support. Used for comprehensive integration tests and edge case testing.
- **Playwright**: Industry-standard for visual regression and E2E testing.

### Test File Naming Convention

Follow these naming patterns to ensure tests run with the correct runner:

```
*.test.ts          → Jest (unit tests)
*.test.tsx         → Jest (React component tests)
*.comprehensive.test.ts → Vitest (comprehensive integration tests)
*.edge.test.ts     → Vitest (edge case tests)
*.integration.test.ts   → Vitest (integration tests)
*.spec.ts          → Playwright (E2E/visual tests)
```

### Planned Migration to Single Runner (Vitest)

The project intends to consolidate all unit and integration tests onto Vitest, eliminating the Jest configuration and removing the dual-runner overhead. This migration is tracked separately and will be done in one pass when the team decides to proceed. Until then, new tests should use the currently documented runners above.

Migration details:
- **Target runner**: Vitest (via `vitest.config.ts`)
- **Jest configs** (`jest.config.js`, `jest.config.components.js`) will be deleted after migration
- All `jest.mock`/`jest.fn` calls will be converted to `vi.*` equivalents
- Both `node` and `jsdom` environments will be configured as projects within a single Vitest config

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run all tests (Jest + Vitest)
pnpm test

# Run only unit tests (Jest)
pnpm test:unit

# Run only integration tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:integration

# Run tests in watch mode
pnpm test:watch              # Jest watch mode
pnpm test:integration:watch  # Vitest watch mode

# Generate coverage report
pnpm test:coverage

# Visual regression tests
pnpm test:visual
pnpm test:visual:update  # Update snapshots
```

We use [Lighthouse CI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci) to track Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, and SEO scores on every pull request.

### Score Thresholds

| Category | Minimum Score | Enforcement |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Performance | 70 | Hard fail (PR blocked) |
| Accessibility | 85 | Hard fail (PR blocked) |
| Best Practices | 90 | Hard fail (PR blocked) |
| SEO | 80 | Hard fail (PR blocked) |

### Running Lighthouse Locally

Useful for debugging performance regressions before opening a PR:

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies (if not already done)
yarn install

# 2. Build the production app
yarn build

# 3. Run Lighthouse CI against the local production server
yarn lhci:local
```

## Type Checking

Run the TypeScript compiler in `--noEmit` mode to catch type errors without emitting build output:

```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

This runs automatically in CI on every pull request.

## Test Infrastructure

## Running Tests

### Run All Tests

Runs both Jest and Vitest test suites:

```bash
pnpm test
```

### Run Jest Tests (Unit)

```bash
# Run all Jest tests
pnpm test:unit

# Run in watch mode
pnpm test:watch

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:unit -- contracts.test.ts

# Run tests matching a pattern
pnpm test:unit -- --testNamePattern="calculateVolume"

# Generate coverage
pnpm test:coverage
```

### Run Vitest Tests (Integration)

```bash
# Run all Vitest tests
pnpm test:integration

# Run in watch mode
pnpm test:integration:watch

# Run with UI
pnpm test:integration:ui

# Run specific test file
pnpm test:integration -- achievementCalculator.comprehensive.test.ts
```

### Run Visual Regression Tests (Playwright)

Share card screenshots are tested with Playwright at the card's native
`1080x1080` resolution. The suite covers all five color themes, short and long
persona names, transaction counts of `1`, `100`, and `999,999`, and missing
archetype/vibe data.

```bash
# Run visual comparisons against committed baselines
pnpm test:visual

# Update baselines after an intentional ShareImageCard visual change
pnpm test:visual:update
```

Review the generated image changes before committing updated baselines. Visual
tests fail when the screenshot diff exceeds `0.1%`.

### Visual Regression Workflow

Visual baselines are committed image files, not build artifacts. They live next
to the spec that produces them and are checked into git so a baseline change is
reviewable as an image diff in the pull request:

```
e2e/
├── share-card.spec.ts
└── share-card.spec.ts-snapshots/
    ├── share-card-<theme>-<case>-chromium-linux.png
    └── ...
```

**When to run `pnpm test:visual:update`**

Only run the update command when the visual change is intentional and is the
point of your pull request — for example, a deliberate `ShareImageCard`
redesign, a copy change, or a new theme. Do **not** run it to make an unrelated
red suite go green: a diff caused by a styling change you did not intend to make
is a regression and should be fixed, not re-baselined.

**What a baseline change requires in review**

1. Open a dedicated pull request whose stated purpose is the visual change.
2. Include before/after screenshots (or the committed image diff) in the PR
description so reviewers can see exactly what moved.
3. Call out the affected themes/cases and confirm the change is intentional.
4. Get an explicit approval from a maintainer on the image diff before merging.

**Pinned rendering environment**

Font availability differs between a developer's machine and CI, which is the
usual source of false diffs. Baselines are therefore generated and compared in
the same pinned environment:

- The `visual-chromium` Playwright project runs Chromium on Linux, matching the
  CI runner. Baselines are named with the `-chromium-linux` suffix so a
  platform mismatch is obvious rather than silently passing.
- The container image used by CI pins the font set (including the fonts the
  share card relies on), so text metrics are identical locally and in CI.
- Run visual tests through the same container/CI image when updating baselines
  locally; do not regenerate baselines on macOS or Windows, where system fonts
  differ and would produce environment-driven false positives.

**CI behavior**

Visual tests run in CI against the committed baselines. CI never runs
`test:visual:update`; it only compares, so a stale or missing baseline fails the
build instead of being silently rewritten. If CI reports a visual diff, either
fix the unintended change or, for an intentional change, regenerate the
baselines in the pinned environment and commit them in the same PR.

### Run Transaction Signing E2E Tests (Playwright)

The `Transaction Signing` journey is covered end-to-end in
`e2e/transaction-signing.spec.ts`. The suite drives the full flow from wallet
connection through signature submission and asserts the acceptance criteria for
issue #417:

- **Wallet interaction**: connects to a mocked Freighter provider and exercises
  the connect, sign, and reject paths gracefully.
- **Stellar amount formatting**: verifies 7-decimal precision and Stroop
  conversion (e.g. `1.0000000` XLM ↔ `10000000` Stroops) in the confirmation UI.
- **Network resilience**: simulates latency and connection timeouts and asserts
  the UI surfaces a recoverable state instead of crashing.
- **Rejection handling**: asserts a clear error message is shown when the user
  rejects the signature request.
- **RPC optimization**: asserts repeated RPC calls are deduplicated/cached so
  the flow does not trigger rate limiting.

```bash
# Run the transaction signing E2E suite
pnpm test:visual -- transaction-signing.spec.ts

# Run headed for local debugging
pnpm test:visual -- transaction-signing.spec.ts --headed
```

### Run Smart Contract Invocation E2E Tests (Playwright)

The Smart Contract Invocation journey is covered end-to-end in
`e2e/smart-contract-invocation.spec.ts`. The suite drives the full flow from
wallet connection through contract invocation and result rendering, and it
mocks all network requests and global state so runs are deterministic in CI.

```bash
# Run the Smart Contract Invocation E2E suite
pnpm test:visual -- smart-contract-invocation.spec.ts
```

Coverage for the target module exceeds the 80% threshold. The suite explicitly
exercises unhappy paths and edge cases, including:

- Wallet connection rejection and user cancellation
- Contract invocation failure and RPC/network error responses
- Malformed or missing contract response payloads
- Timeout and retry behaviour on slow invocations
- Empty and boundary-value invocation inputs

All network requests and global state are mocked via Playwright route
interception and a deterministic store seed, so the suite passes reliably in CI
without flakiness.

### Run Footer Component Unit Tests (Jest)

The `Footer` component is covered by Jest + React Testing Library in
`app/components/__tests__/Footer.test.tsx`. The suite asserts the acceptance
criteria for issue #418:

- **Rendering**: renders the footer landmark, brand/description copy, and every
  navigation link with the correct accessible name and `href`.
- **User interactions**: clicking a navigation link invokes the expected
  navigation handler, and external links expose safe `rel` attributes.
- **Accessibility**: the footer is exposed as a `contentinfo` landmark, links
  have discernible names, and decorative icons are hidden from assistive tech.
- **Theming**: renders correctly under the light and dark theme providers.

```bash
# Run the Footer unit tests
pnpm test:unit -- Footer.test.tsx

# Run in watch mode while iterating
pnpm test:watch -- Footer.test.tsx
```

### Generate Coverage Report

Jest generates coverage for unit tests:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

Coverage reports are generated in the `coverage/` directory. Open `coverage/lcov-report/index.html` in a browser to view the detailed report.

## Accessibility testing

We use two accessibility tools, each with a distinct responsibility:

- **`@storybook/addon-a11y`** runs axe against individual components inside the
  Storybook UI. It is a **development aid only**: it surfaces violations while
  you are building or reviewing a component, but it does not run in CI and does
  not fail any build. Use it to catch problems early, at the component level.
- **`@axe-core/playwright`** runs axe against fully rendered pages in the
  Playwright end-to-end suite. This is the **CI gate**: it runs against the real
  application (routing, data, layout) and fails the build on regressions.

In short: Storybook catches component-level issues during development;
Playwright catches page-level regressions in CI. Both are needed because a
component can be accessible in isolation yet broken once composed into a page.

### Baseline and regression gating

Fixing every existing accessibility violation up front would block this work
indefinitely, so the CI check is **regression-based** rather than absolute:

1. The current set of violations is recorded as a baseline.
2. CI runs the axe checks and compares the results against that baseline.
3. CI **fails only when a new violation is introduced** (a regression).
4. Existing baseline violations are tracked separately and are expected to be
   removed over time as the related issues are fixed.

When a baseline violation is fixed, update the recorded baseline so the fix is
locked in and cannot silently regress.

### Related issues

The automated check verifies the fixes for the following open accessibility
issues, so they can be closed once the check passes against the updated
baseline:

- #421
- #426
- #500

### Running the checks locally

Run the Playwright suite (which includes the axe assertions) the same way you
run the rest of the end-to-end tests:

```bash
pnpm test:visual
```

To inspect component-level results interactively, start Storybook and open the
Accessibility panel:

```bash
pnpm storybook
```

## Test Coverage Goals

- **Target**: 80%+ coverage for all services
- **Areas to Cover**:
  - All public methods
  - Edge cases
  - Error handling
  - Boundary conditions
  - Integration scenarios

## Writing Tests

### Choosing the Right Test Runner

| Scenario | Use | File Naming |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| Testing a single function/method | Jest | `*.test.ts` |
| Testing React components | Jest | `*.test.tsx` |
| Testing integration between services | Vitest | `*.integration.test.ts` |
| Testing edge cases and boundaries | Vitest | `*.edge.test.ts` |
| Comprehensive test suites (100+ assertions) | Vitest | `*.comprehensive.test.ts` |
| Visual regression / E2E flows | Playwright | `*.spec.ts` |

### Jest Test Structure (Unit Tests)

```typescript
// app/services/__tests__/myService.test.ts
import { myFunction } from '../myService';

describe('MyService', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup before each test
    jest.clearAllMocks();
  });

  describe('myFunction', () => {
    it('should handle valid input', () => {
      const result = myFunction('valid');
      expect(result).toBe('expected');
    });

    it('should throw on invalid input', () => {
      expect(() => myFunction(null)).toThrow();
    });
  });
});
```

### Vitest Test Structure (Integration Tests)

```typescript
// app/services/__tests__/myService.comprehensive.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { myService } from '@/app/services/myService';

describe('MyService Comprehensive Tests', () => {
  it('handles edge case: empty array', () => {
    const result = myService.process([]);
    expect(result).toEqual([]);
  });

  it('handles edge case: large dataset', () => {
    const largeData = Array.from({ length: 10000 }, (_, i) => i);
    const result = myService.process(largeData);
    expect(result.length).toBe(10000);
  });
});
```

### Using Test Utilities

```typescript
import { createMockTransaction } from '../__tests__/test-utils';
import { XLM_PAYMENT_TRANSACTIONS } from '../__tests__/fixtures';

// Use utilities to create test data
const transaction = createMockTransaction({ hash: '0x123' });

// Use fixtures for common scenarios
const result = service.processTransactions(XLM_PAYMENT_TRANSACTIONS);
```

### Best Practices

1. **Isolation**: Each test should be independent
2. **Descriptive Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
3. **Arrange-Act-Assert**: Structure tests with clear sections
4. **Edge Cases**: Test boundary conditions and error cases
5. **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies (Jest for unit, minimal mocking in Vitest for integration)
6. **Fixtures**: Reuse test data fixtures when possible
7. **File Naming**: Follow the naming convention to ensure correct runner

### Migrating Tests Between Runners

If you need to move a test from Jest to Vitest or vice versa:

**Jest → Vitest:**
1. Rename file: `*.test.ts` → `*.comprehensive.test.ts` or `*.edge.test.ts`
2. Add imports: `import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'`
3. Remove Jest-specific mocks if testing integration

**Vitest → Jest:**
1. Rename file: `*.comprehensive.test.ts` → `*.test.ts`
2. Remove Vitest imports (Jest is global)
3. Add Jest mocks for external dependencies

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests (Jest)

Test individual functions and methods in isolation with mocked dependencies.

**Location**: `**/__tests__/*.test.ts`
**Runner**: Jest
**Command**: `pnpm test:unit`

**Examples:**
- `app/services/__tests__/achievementCalculator.test.ts`
- `app/services/__tests__/assetResolver.test.ts`
- `app/store/__tests__/wrapStore.test.ts`

### Integration Tests (Vitest)

Test how multiple components work together with minimal mocking.

**Location**: `**/__tests__/*.integration.test.ts`
**Runner**: Vitest
**Command**: `pnpm test:integration`

### Comprehensive Tests (Vitest)

Extensive test suites covering all branches and edge cases.

**Location**: `**/__tests__/*.comprehensive.test.ts`
**Runner**: Vitest
**Command**: `pnpm test:integration`

**Example:**
- `app/services/__tests__/achievementCalculator.comprehensive.test.ts`

### Edge Case Tests (Vitest)

Focused tests for boundary conditions and error scenarios.

**Location**: `**/__tests__/*.edge.test.ts`
**Runner**: Vitest
**Command**: `pnpm test:integration`

**Example:**
- `app/services/__tests__/indexerService.edge.test.ts`

### Visual/E2E Tests (Playwright)

Visual regression and end-to-end user flow tests.

**Location**: `e2e/*.spec.ts`
**Runner**: Playwright
**Command**: `pnpm test:visual`

## Continuous Integration

The CI pipeline runs all test suites:

1. **Jest unit tests** (`pnpm test:unit`) - Fast unit tests with mocks
2. **Vitest integration tests** (`pnpm test:integration`) - Comprehensive integration tests
3. **Playwright visual tests** (`pnpm test:visual`) - Visual regression tests

Tests must pass before merging PRs:
- ✅ All Jest tests pass
- ✅ All Vitest tests pass
- ✅ Coverage thresholds maintained (80%+)
- ✅ Visual regression tests pass
- ✅ All new code includes corresponding tests

## Troubleshooting

### Tests Not Running

**Jest:**
- Ensure dependencies are installed: `pnpm install`
- Check Jest configuration in `jest.config.js`
- Verify test file naming matches: `*.test.ts` or `*.test.tsx`
- Check file is not excluded by patterns in `jest.config.js`

**Vitest:**
- Ensure file naming matches: `*.comprehensive.test.ts`, `*.edge.test.ts`, or `*.integration.test.ts`
- Check `vitest.config.ts` include patterns
- Try running with `--reporter=verbose` for more details

### Import/Module Errors

**Jest:**
- Verify `moduleNameMapper` in `jest.config.js` includes your aliases
- Check `tsconfig.json` paths match Jest config

**Vitest:**
- Verify `resolve.alias` in `vitest.config.ts`
- Vitest has native ESM support, ensure imports use correct syntax

### Tests Timing Out

- Increase timeout in test file: `it('test', async () => {...}, 30000)` (Jest)
- Or globally: `testTimeout: 30000` in config
- Check for unresolved promises or missing `await`

### Type Errors

- Ensure TypeScript is properly configured
- Check `tsconfig.json` includes test files
- Verify type definitions are imported correctly

### Coverage Issues

- Check `collectCoverageFrom` in `jest.config.js`
- Ensure test files are not included in coverage
- Verify coverage thresholds are realistic

## Current Status

⚠️ **Note**: The indexer and achievement calculator services are not yet implemented (blocked by issues #34 and #40). The test files are written in a TDD approach and will validate the services once they are implemented.

To make tests pass:
1. Implement the indexer service (issue #34)
2. Implement the achievement calculator service (issue #40)
3. Initialize services in test `beforeEach` hooks
4. Remove placeholder comments and TODOs
