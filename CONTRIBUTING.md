# Contributing to Stellar Wrap

## Where components live

All React components go in `app/components/`, grouped into subfolders when a
feature has several (for example `app/components/Loading/`). This follows the
Next.js App Router convention of keeping app code under `app/`, next to the
routes, hooks, store, and utils that components import. Route-specific UI that
is not shared can still sit next to its route in `app/[locale]/...`.

The top-level `components/` and `src/components/` trees are retired: ESLint
fails on any file added there. Non-component code in `src/` (hooks, services,
store, utils) is unaffected.

## Contact List architecture

The Contact List is the reusable address book used across the app to
pick, save, and manage frequently used Stellar addresses. It is split
into a small set of decoupled pieces so the same list can be embedded in
different flows (e.g. withdraw) without duplicating logic.

### Key files

- `app/components/contact-list/` — presentational components for the list,
  rows, and the add/edit form. These are intentionally dumb: they render
  props and emit callbacks, and hold no persistence logic.
- `hooks/use-contact-list.ts` — the single source of truth for Contact
  List state. It owns loading, adding, updating, and removing contacts
  and exposes them to consumers.
- `lib/contact-list.ts` — pure helpers for validation, normalization,
  and (de)serialization of contacts. Keep these free of React and side
  effects so they stay easy to unit test.
- `types/contact.ts` — shared TypeScript types for a contact and the
  hook's return shape.

### Data flow

1. A consumer (e.g. the withdraw page) calls `useContactList()`.
2. The hook reads persisted contacts, exposes them plus mutation
   callbacks, and keeps state in sync after each mutation.
3. Presentational components receive contacts and callbacks as props and
   render the UI. They never read or write storage directly.
4. Pure helpers in `lib/contact-list.ts` validate and normalize input
   before it is persisted.

### State management conventions

- All Contact List state lives in `useContactList`; do not duplicate it
  in components.
- Components stay presentational and reusable — pass data and callbacks
  down, never reach for global state.
- Keep types strict. `any` is prohibited; extend the shared types in
  `types/contact.ts` instead.
- Use the project's centralized styling solution; no inline styles.

### Extending or modifying the Contact List

- **New field on a contact**: add it to `types/contact.ts`, handle it in
  the validation/normalization helpers, then surface it in the form and
  row components.
- **New action (e.g. import/export)**: add the logic to
  `useContactList` and expose a callback; keep the UI components
  presentational.
- **Reusing the list elsewhere**: consume `useContactList` and render the
  existing components — do not fork the list.
- **Tests**: cover pure helpers in `lib/contact-list.ts` and hook
  behavior in `useContactList`; UI components should be tested through
  props and callbacks.

## Account Recovery architecture

Account Recovery lets a user regain access to their Stellar Wrap account
when they lose their primary signer. The flow is intentionally small and
lives in a few decoupled modules so it can be reused and tested in
isolation.

### How it works

1. **Initiation** — the user starts recovery from the account settings
   screen. The UI collects the recovery method (e.g. a backup signer or a
   recovery phrase) and hands it to the recovery service.
2. **Verification** — the recovery service validates the provided proof
   against the account's registered recovery configuration. No state is
   mutated until verification succeeds.
3. **Signer rotation** — on success, the service builds and submits the
   transaction that rotates the account signer to the new key.
4. **Confirmation** — the UI reflects the updated signer and clears any
   transient recovery state.

### Key modules

- **Recovery service** — owns the verification and signer-rotation
  logic. It is framework-agnostic and has no UI dependencies.
- **Recovery state** — the small store/hook that tracks the in-progress
  recovery (method, status, errors) for the UI.
- **Recovery UI** — the components that render the flow. They only read
  from and dispatch to the service/state; they contain no recovery
  business logic.

### Maintaining it

- **Extending** — add new recovery methods in the service layer first,
  then surface them through the state hook and UI. Keep the service free
  of UI imports so it stays reusable.
- **Testing** — cover the service's verification and rotation paths with
  unit tests, and the UI flow with component tests. Recovery is
  security-sensitive, so test both the success and failure branches.
- **Types** — keep recovery types strict; `any` is not allowed. Share
  types between the service and UI rather than re-declaring them.
- **Health** — when changing the recovery configuration shape, update
  the service, the state hook, and the docs here together so they never
  drift.

## Handling dependency advisory exceptions

Our CI runs `pnpm audit` on every PR that touches `package.json` or
`pnpm-lock.yaml`, plus a weekly scheduled scan.

If an advisory has no available fix (no patched version exists) and a
maintainer has assessed it as not exploitable in our usage, it can be
suppressed via `pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreCves` in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "pnpm": {
    "auditConfig": {
      "ignoreCves": ["CVE-2024-XXXXX"]
    }
  }
}
```

Before adding an entry:
1. Confirm no patched version is available (`pnpm audit` will say so).
2. Document *why* it's safe to ignore in the PR description that adds the
   exception (e.g. "only affects a build-time-only dependency, never
   shipped to production").
3. Revisit ignored CVEs periodically — remove the entry once a fix ships.

Note: this project pins `pnpm@10.25.0`. If upgraded to pnpm v11+, this
field is renamed to `pnpm.auditConfig.ignoreGhsas` and uses GitHub
Advisory IDs (GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx) instead of CVE numbers.
