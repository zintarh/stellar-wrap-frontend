# Testing Strategy

## Overview

This project uses a **dual test runner strategy** to leverage the strengths of each testing framework:

| Framework | Purpose | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| **Jest** | Unit tests with mocking | Testing isolated functions, components, modules |
| **Vitest** | Integration & comprehensive tests | Testing service interactions, edge cases, large test suites |
| **Playwright** | Visual regression & E2E | Testing UI rendering and user flows |

## File Naming Convention

The test runner is determined by the file naming pattern:

```
✅ *.test.ts          → Jest (unit tests)
✅ *.test.tsx         → Jest (React component tests)
✅ *.comprehensive.test.ts → Vitest (comprehensive test suites)
✅ *.edge.test.ts     → Vitest (edge case tests)
✅ *.integration.test.ts   → Vitest (integration tests)
✅ *.spec.ts          → Playwright (E2E/visual tests)
```

## Decision Matrix

### Use Jest when:
- ✅ Testing a single function or method in isolation
- ✅ Testing React components
- ✅ Need extensive mocking of dependencies
- ✅ Testing Next.js-specific features
- ✅ Writing traditional unit tests

### Use Vitest when:
- ✅ Testing interactions between multiple services
- ✅ Writing comprehensive test suites (100+ assertions)
- ✅ Testing edge cases and boundary conditions
- ✅ Need fast test execution and HMR
- ✅ Testing with minimal or no mocks (integration style)

### Use Playwright when:
- ✅ Testing visual appearance of components
- ✅ Testing complete user flows (E2E)
- ✅ Visual regression testing

## Commands

```bash
# Run all tests (Jest + Vitest)
pnpm test

# Run only unit tests (Jest)
pnpm test:unit

# Run only integration tests (Vitest)
pnpm test:integration

# Watch mode
pnpm test:watch              # Jest
pnpm test:integration:watch  # Vitest

# UI mode (Vitest only)
pnpm test:integration:ui

# Coverage
pnpm test:coverage  # Jest coverage

# Visual tests
pnpm test:visual
pnpm test:visual:update  # Update snapshots

# E2E tests (Playwright)
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

## Configuration Files

| File | Purpose | Key Settings |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `jest.config.js` | Jest configuration | Excludes `*.comprehensive.test.ts` and `*.edge.test.ts` |
| `vitest.config.ts` | Vitest configuration | Includes only `*.comprehensive.test.ts`, `*.edge.test.ts`, `*.integration.test.ts` |
| `playwright.config.ts` | Playwright configuration | Visual regression settings |

## CI Pipeline

Each check runs in exactly one workflow:

| Workflow | Responsibility |
|----------|----------------|
| `code-quality.yml` | ESLint, Prettier and TypeScript (the authoritative lint check) |
| `ci.yml` | Lock file validation, unit tests with coverage, production build, visual regression |
| `storybook.yml` | Storybook build (and GitHub Pages deploy on `main`) |
| `e2e-tests.yml` | Playwright end-to-end tests |
| `lighthouse.yml` | Lighthouse audits |
| `bundle-size.yml` | Bundle analyzer report |
| `dependency-audit.yml` | `pnpm audit` when dependencies change |
| `openapi-lint.yml` | OpenAPI spec lint and route coverage |

pnpm, Node.js, the dependency cache and the install are shared through the
`.github/actions/setup` composite action. Pull requests that only change
Markdown or `docs/` skip the code quality, test, build, Storybook, E2E,
Lighthouse and bundle size workflows.

All checks must pass for PR approval.

## Coverage

Jest generates coverage reports for unit tests:
- **Target**: 80%+ for all metrics
- **Report**: `coverage/lcov-report/index.html`
- **Command**: `pnpm test:coverage`

## E2E Tests

End-to-end tests live under `e2e/` and run with Playwright (`*.spec.ts`). They exercise complete user journeys against the running app, mocking network requests and global state so runs are deterministic in CI.

### Smart Contract Invocation Flow

The Smart Contract Invocation journey is covered end-to-end in `e2e/smart-contract-invocation.spec.ts`. The suite walks a user from opening the invocation page through connecting a wallet, entering contract details, submitting the invocation, and confirming the result. It also covers the unhappy paths and edge cases required by the acceptance criteria:

- **Happy path**: connect wallet → fill contract address, method, and arguments → submit → success confirmation with the returned transaction hash.
- **Validation errors**: missing/invalid contract address, empty method name, and malformed JSON arguments surface inline errors and block submission.
- **Wallet errors**: rejected connection and rejected signature requests show a recoverable error state without losing entered form data.
- **Network errors**: RPC/indexer failures are mocked to return errors and the UI shows a retry affordance that succeeds on the next attempt.
- **Edge cases**: empty argument list, very large argument payloads, and duplicate submissions (button disabled while pending) are asserted.

Network requests are intercepted with `page.route(...)` and global wallet state is stubbed via `page.addInitScript(...)`, so no real chain or wallet is required. Tests use role/text-based locators and explicit `expect(...).toBeVisible()` waits (no arbitrary timeouts) to stay reliable and flake-free in CI.

## Examples

### Jest Unit Test Example

```typescript
// app/services/__tests__/myService.test.ts
import { myFunction } from '../myService';

describe('MyService', () => {
  it('should process valid input', () => {
    const result = myFunction({ value: 42 });
    expect(result).toBe(84);
  });

  it('should throw on invalid input', () => {
    expect(() => myFunction(null)).toThrow('Invalid input');
  });
});
```

### Vitest Integration Test Example

```typescript
// app/services/__tests__/myService.comprehensive.test.ts
import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest';
import { myService } from '@/app/services/myService';

describe('MyService Comprehensive Tests', () => {
  it('handles edge case: empty dataset', () => {
    const result = myService.process([]);
    expect(result).toEqual({ count: 0, items: [] });
  });

  it('handles edge case: large dataset', () => {
    const largeData = Array.from({ length: 100000 }, (_, i) => i);
    const result = myService.process(largeData);
    expect(result.count).toBe(100000);
  });

  it('integrates with cache and indexer', () => {
    // Test with real dependencies, minimal mocking
    const result = myService.fullFlow();
    expect(result.cached).toBe(true);
    expect(result.indexed).toBe(true);
  });
});
```

### Playwright E2E Test Example

```typescript
// e2e/transaction-signing.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test.describe('Transaction Signing flow', () => {
  test('signs a transaction end to end', async ({ page }) => {
    await page.goto('/');
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Connect Wallet' }).click();
    await page.getByRole('button', { name: 'Sign Transaction' }).click();
    await expect(page.getByText('Transaction signed')).toBeVisible();
  });
});
```

```typescript
// e2e/smart-contract-invocation.spec.ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('invokes a smart contract successfully', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.route('**/api/rpc', (route) =>
    route.fulfill({ status: 200, body: JSON.stringify({ txHash: '0xabc' }) }),
  );

  await page.goto('/en/invoke');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /connect wallet/i }).click();
  await page.getByLabel(/contract address/i).fill('0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000');
  await page.getByLabel(/method/i).fill('transfer');
  await page.getByRole('button', { name: /invoke/i }).click();

  await expect(page.getByText(/0xabc/)).toBeVisible();
});
```

## Transaction Signing E2E Tests

The `Transaction Signing` user journey is critical and covered by Playwright E2E tests in `e2e/transaction-signing.spec.ts`. These tests simulate a user going through the flow from start to finish and must satisfy the following acceptance criteria:

- **Wallet interaction**: Connect and interact gracefully with the target Web3 wallet (e.g., Freighter). Wallet APIs are stubbed via `page.addInitScript` so the flow is deterministic and does not depend on a real extension.
- **Stellar amount formatting**: Verify correct parsing and formatting of Stellar amounts, including 7 decimal precision and Stroops conversion (e.g., `1.0000000` XLM ↔ `10000000` Stroops).
- **Network latency & timeouts**: Simulate slow RPC responses and connection timeouts to confirm the UI degrades gracefully without crashing.
- **Rejected signature**: Assert a clear error message is displayed when the user rejects the transaction signature.
- **RPC optimization**: Assert that RPC calls are deduplicated/cached so repeated renders do not trigger redundant requests that could cause rate-limiting.

### Running the Transaction Signing E2E Tests

```bash
# Run the full E2E suite
pnpm test:e2e

# Run only the Transaction Signing flow
pnpm test:e2e -- e2e/transaction-signing.spec.ts

# Debug interactively
pnpm test:e2e:ui
```

## Migration Guide

### Moving a Test from Jest to Vitest

1. Rename file: `myService.test.ts` → `myService.comprehensive.test.ts`
2. Add Vitest imports: `import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'`
3. Replace Jest mocks with real implementations (if testing integration)
4. Update any Jest-specific syntax

### Moving a Test from Vitest to Jest

1. Rename file: `myService.comprehensive.test.ts` → `myService.test.ts`
2. Remove Vitest imports (Jest is global)
3. Add mocks for external dependencies
4. Update any Vitest-specific syntax

## Best Practices

1. **Follow naming conventions** - File names determine which runner executes the test
2. **Keep tests focused** - Unit tests in Jest, integration in Vitest
3. **Avoid mixing patterns** - Don't put comprehensive tests in `*.test.ts` files
4. **Mock appropriately** - Heavy mocking in Jest, minimal in Vitest
5. **Run locally** - Test with both runners before pushing
6. **Check CI** - Ensure both test suites pass in CI

## Troubleshooting

### Test file not running?

Check the file naming:
- Jest: Must end with `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx`
- Vitest: Must end with `.comprehensive.test.ts`, `.edge.test.ts`, or `.integration.test.ts`
- Playwright: Must end with `.spec.ts`

### Import errors?

- **Jest**: Check `moduleNameMapper` in `jest.config.js`
- **Vitest**: Check `resolve.alias` in `vitest.config.ts`

### Tests timing out?

- Increase timeout: `it('test', async () => {...}, 30000)`
- Or set globally in config

## Summary

This dual-strategy approach gives us:

✅ **Fast unit tests** with Jest's mature mocking ecosystem  
✅ **Comprehensive integration tests** with Vitest's speed and modern features  
✅ **Clear separation** through file naming conventions  
✅ **No conflicts** - each runner handles its own test files  
✅ **CI confidence** - both suites run on every PR
